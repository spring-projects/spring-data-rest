{% capture billboard_description %}
Spring Data REST is part of the umbrella [Spring Data](#) project that makes it easy to expose JPA based repositories as RESTful endpoints.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture main_content %}
The goal of the Spring Data REST project is to provide a solid foundation on which to expose CRUD operations to your JPA Repository-managed entities using plain HTTP REST semantics. The first implementation of this exporter uses Spring MVC and the standard Servlet architecture to make it easy to deploy a WAR file that becomes a full-blown CRUD application simply by including your domain classes and their corresponding Repository definitions. Future implementations will allow you to export your repositories in non-Servlet HTTP environments using high-throughput non-blocking IO, and will provide enhanced HTML5 capabilities.

## Features

* Supports JPA, MongoDB, Gemfire, and Neo4J Repositories
* Create new entities (auto-generated or pre-assigned IDs are both supported) using POST
* Update existing entities using PUT
* Delete entities using DELETE
* Manage entity relationships using POST, PUT, DELETE
* Discover services and get or list available entities using GET
* Search entities through Repository query methods using GET
* Validate entities with JSR-303 or Spring Validator beans
* Extend the REST exporter's functionality by capturing ApplicationEvents
* Configure path and rel values using annotations or DSL config helper
* Page large results sets
* Sort results
