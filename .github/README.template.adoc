= Spring Data REST image:https://img.shields.io/badge/Revved%20up%20by-Develocity-06A0CE?logo=Gradle&labelColor=02303A["Revved up by Develocity", link="https://ge.spring.io/scans?search.rootProjectNames=Spring Data REST"]

The goal of the project is to provide a flexible and configurable mechanism for writing simple services that can be exposed over HTTP.

This takes your Spring Data repositories and front-ends them with HTTP, allowing you full CRUD capability over your entities, to include managing associations.

== Features

* Exposes a discoverable REST API for your domain model using HAL as media type.
* Exposes https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#repository-resources[collection, item and association resources] representing your model.
* Supports pagination via https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#paging-and-sorting[navigational links].
* Allows to dynamically filter collection resources.
* Exposes dedicated https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#repository-resources.query-method-resource[search resources for query methods] defined in your repositories.
* Allows to https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#events[hook into the handling of REST requests] by handling Spring `ApplicationEvents`.
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#metadata[Exposes metadata] about the model discovered as ALPS and JSON Schema.
* Allows to define client specific representations through https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#projections-excerpts[projections].
* Ships the latest release of https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#tools.hal-explorer[HAL Explorer] to easily explore HAL and HAL-FORMS based HTTP responses.
* Supports JPA, MongoDB, Neo4j, Solr, Cassandra, Gemfire.
* Allows https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#customizing-sdr[advanced customizations] of the default resources exposed.

== Getting Started

Here is a quick teaser of an application using Spring Data REST in Java:

[source,java]
----
@CrossOrigin
@RepositoryRestResource(path = "people")
public interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, Long> {

  List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);

  @RestResource(path = "byFirstname")
  List<Person> findByFirstnameLike(String firstname);
}

@Configuration
@EnableMongoRepositories
class ApplicationConfig extends AbstractMongoConfiguration {

  @Override
  public MongoClient mongoClient() {
    return new MongoClient();
  }

  @Override
  protected String getDatabaseName() {
    return "springdata";
  }
}
----

[source,bash]
----
curl -v "http://localhost:8080/people/search/byFirstname?firstname=Oliver*&sort=name,desc"
----

* https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-mongodb-data-rest/[Accessing MongoDB Data with REST] is a guide to creating a REST web service exposing data stored in MongoDB through repositories.
* https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-neo4j-data-rest/[Accessing Neo4j Data with REST] is a guide to creating a REST web service exposing data stored in Neo4j through repositories.
* https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-gemfire-data-rest/[Accessing GemFire Data with REST] is a guide to creating a REST web service exposing data stored in Pivotal GemFire through repositories.
