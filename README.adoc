The goal of the project is to provide a flexible and configurable mechanism for writing simple services that can be exposed over HTTP.

The first exporter implemented is a JPA Repository exporter. This takes your JPA repositories and front-ends them with HTTP, allowing you full CRUD capability over your entities, to include managing associations.

== Features

* Exposes a discoverable REST API for your domain model using HAL as media type.
* Exposes https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#repository-resources[collection, item and association resources] representing your model.
* Supports pagination via https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#paging-and-sorting[navigational links].
* Allows to dynamically filter collection resources.
* Exposes dedicated https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#repository-resources.query-method-resource[search resources for query methods] defined in your repositories.
* Allows to https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#events[hook into the handling of REST requests] by handling Spring `ApplicationEvents`.
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#metadata[Exposes metadata] about the model discovered as ALPS and JSON Schema.
* Allows to define client specific representations through https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#projections-excerpts[projections].
* Ships the latest release of https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#tools.hal-explorer[HAL Explorer] to easily explore HAL and HAL-FORMS based HTTP responses.
* Currently supports JPA, MongoDB, Neo4j, Solr, Cassandra, Gemfire.
* Allows https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#customizing-sdr[advanced customizations] of the default resources exposed.

== Code of Conduct

This project is governed by the https://github.com/spring-projects/.github/blob/e3cc2ff230d8f1dca06535aa6b5a4a23815861d4/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[Spring Code of Conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code of conduct. Please report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Getting Started

Here is a quick teaser of an application using Spring Data REST in Java:

[source,java]
----
@CrossOrigin
@RepositoryRestResource(path = "people")
public interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, Long> {

  List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);

  @RestResource(path = "byFirstname")
  List<Person> findByFirstnameLike(String firstname);
}

@Configuration
@EnableMongoRepositories
class ApplicationConfig extends AbstractMongoConfiguration {

  @Override
  public MongoClient mongoClient() {
    return new MongoClient();
  }

  @Override
  protected String getDatabaseName() {
    return "springdata";
  }
}
----

[source,bash]
----
curl -v "http://localhost:8080/people/search/byFirstname?firstname=Oliver*&sort=name,desc"
----

=== Maven configuration

Add the Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-rest</artifactId>
  <version>${version}.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----

If you'd rather like the latest snapshots of the upcoming major version, use our Maven snapshot repository and declare the appropriate dependency version.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-rest</artifactId>
  <version>${version}.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<repository>
  <id>spring-libs-snapshot</id>
  <name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
</repository>

== Getting Help

Having trouble with Spring Data? We’d love to help!

* Check the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/[reference documentation], and https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/api/[Javadocs].
* Learn the Spring basics – Spring Data builds on Spring Framework, check the https://spring.io[spring.io] web-site for a wealth of reference documentation.
If you are just starting out with Spring, try one of the https://spring.io/guides[guides].
* If you are upgrading, check out the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/changelog.txt[changelog] for "`new and noteworthy`" features.
* Ask a question - we monitor https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com] for questions tagged with https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-data[`spring-data-rest`].
You can also chat with the community on https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data[Gitter].
* Report bugs with Spring Data REST at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-rest/issues.

== Reporting Issues

Spring Data uses GitHub as issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please search the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-rest/issues[issue tracker] to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue doesn’t already exist, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-rest/issues[create a new issue].
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of Spring Data that you are using and JVM version.
* If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use GitHub's flavor of Markdown and wrap your code with *triple-backquotes*.
* If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. Attach a link to your code or a compressed file containing your code.

== Building from Source

You don’t need to build from source to use Spring Data (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Data can be easily built with the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper].
You also need JDK 1.8.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.5.0 or above].

_Also see link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] if you wish to submit pull requests, and in particular please sign the https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor’s Agreement] before your first non-trivial change._

=== Building reference documentation

Building the documentation builds also the project without running tests.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install -Pdistribute
----

The generated documentation is available from `target/site/reference/html/index.html`.
