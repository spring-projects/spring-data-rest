/**
 * <p>
 * Operation to copy a value from the given "from" path to the given "path". Will throw a {@link PatchException} if
 * either path is invalid or if the object at the from path is not assignable to the given path.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: When dealing with lists, the copy operation may yield undesirable results. If a list is produced from a
 * database query, it's likely that the list contains items with a unique ID. Copying an item in the list will result
 * with a list that has a duplicate object, with the same ID. The best case post-patch scenario is that each copy of the
 * item will be saved, unchanged, to the database and later queries for the list will not include the duplicate. The
 * worst case post-patch scenario is that a following operation changes some properties of the copy, but does not change
 * the ID. When saved, both the original and the copy will be saved, but the last one saved will overwrite the first.
 * Effectively only one copy will survive post-save.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In light of this, it's probably a good idea to perform a "replace" after a "copy" to set the ID property (which may
 * or may not be "id").
